# [austinwilliams.dev](https://austinwilliams.dev/)

My personal web app made with the [React](https://react.dev/) front-end and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) state manager. It's built using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/au-williams/austinwilliams.dev/actions) CI/CD — accessible online at [https://austinwilliams.dev/](https://austinwilliams.dev/). ⚡🚀

> [!NOTE]
> This web app is accessible at the [`.net`](https://austinwilliams.net) and [`.org`](https://austinwilliams.org) top-level domains too! They redirect to the [`.dev`](https://austinwilliams.dev) domain. But the `.com` domain is owned by an advertising agency which keeps it out of my reach for this project. 🌠

This project can be started with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
$ npm start

<!-- And be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Style sheets are made with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and compile into CSS on build. Most Sass files are named `*.module.scss` to use CSS modules which are CSS files that have their class names and animation names scoped locally by default.

## Settings

<details>

<!-- app-config.ts settings -->

<summary>🛠️ /src/config/app-config.ts</summary>

### [🛠️ /src/config/app-config.ts](src/config/app-config.ts)

This file contains the settings variables for logic across the web app, most of which belongs to the code generation algorithm. My philosophy is that art imitates reality - but only to an extent - because reality was not designed to be asthetically pleasant. Generation settings include how many code lines are visible, how long a code line can be, how far the indentation can expand, etc. Settings pertaining to [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) can be found here too.

</details>

<!-- _variables.module.scss settings -->

<details>

<summary>🛠️ /src/styles/_variables.module.scss</summary>

### [🛠️ /src/styles/_variables.module.scss](src/styles/_variables.module.scss)

This file contains the settings variables for styles across the web app. I prefer building my views so everything is in place before fine-tuning styles by eye so most design properties will be found here such as base colors, durations, sizes, and more.

This file name starts with an underscore to make use of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)'s partial functionality, which are files containing snippets of CSS that can be included in other Sass files. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should <ins>not</ins> be generated into a CSS file. Read more here: https://sass-lang.com/guide/#partials
